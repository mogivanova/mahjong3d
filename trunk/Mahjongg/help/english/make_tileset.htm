<h1>How to make your own tile set</h1>
<p>
It    is    easy   enough to make your own tile set for <i>Amazing Mahjongg
3D</i>.  First, you have    to  make  images  for  all of tiles. Each image
must be in separate file.  Better,    but   not   necessary,   if   all  of
images   have  same dimensions.  Tiles    are   shown   most correctly when
width  of tile image is  75%  of  its  height  (for example 100 pixels wide
and  75 pixels high). Images must be in <span class="highlight">.JPG</span>
format.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards you should set names for image files:
<ul>
<li>Empty tile used for tile sides and backwards is named <span class="highlight">00.jpg</span></li>
<li>Tiles of dots (circles) suit have names from <span class="highlight">01.jpg</span> to <span class="highlight">09.jpg</span></li>
<li>Tiles of bamboo (sticks) suit have names from <span class="highlight">11.jpg</span> to <span class="highlight">19.jpg</span></li>
<li>Tiles of characters suit have names from <span class="highlight">21.jpg</span> to <span class="highlight">29.jpg</span></li>
<li>Winds are named from <span class="highlight">31.jpg</span> to <span class="highlight">34.jpg</span> (North, South, East, West)</li>
<li>Dragons  are  named <span class="highlight">10.jpg</span> for White, <span class="highlight">20.jpg</span> for Green and <span class="highlight">30.jpg</span> for Red one.</li>
<li>Season tiles have names <span class="highlight">35.jpg</span>, <span class="highlight">36.jpg</span>, <span class="highlight">37.jpg</span>, <span class="highlight">38.jpg</span></li>
<li>Flower tiles have names <span class="highlight">39.jpg</span>, <span class="highlight">40.jpg</span>, <span class="highlight">41.jpg</span>, <span class="highlight">42.jpg</span></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Therefore you will got set of 43 files named from <span class="highlight">00.jpg</span> to <span class="highlight">42.jpg</span>.
</p>

<p>
If   you  want  to place additional information about this tileset and your
name,   you   have  to  create  text  file  named <span class="highlight">tileset.ini</span> (make it with
Notepad.exe for example).
</p>

<p>
It must contain several lines in form 'name = value'. Valid names are 'Name' and 'Author'. For example, your tileset.ini might look like<br/>
Name=My first great tile set<br/>
Author=Great tile set creator<br/>
</p>

<p>
Now   you  compress  all those files (<span class="highlight">00.jpg</span> - <span class="highlight">42.jpg</span> and <span class="highlight">tileset.ini</span>) with
any  .ZIP  compression  utility (WinZip, PkZip, etc.).  It's up to you to leave extension of this
file  as   .zip   or   to   change  it  to  <span class="highlight">.mjt</span>.  
</p>

<p>
Your  tile set is ready.
Place it under <span class="highlight">Amazing Mahjongg\Tile sets</span> directory.
