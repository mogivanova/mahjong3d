<h1>Solitaire rules
</h1>
<p>
Rules  of  this  game are simple. Your goal is to remove all tiles from the
board.
</p>

<p>
You  simple  have to choose with the cursor two similar tiles on the board.
Selected  tiles  will  be  removed.  Tiles  have to be free, so you can not
select tile, closed by others from both left and right, or from top.
</p>

<p>
Remember  that  you  can  combine  any flowers
and also you can combine any seasons.
</p>

<p>
Game  is over, when you have removed all tiles from the board, or if you do
not have two free matching tiles to remove.
