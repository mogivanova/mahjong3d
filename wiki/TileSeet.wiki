and the characters (also called characks, cracks, or wan):

1 of characters 2 of characters 3 of characters 4 of characters 5 of characters 6 of characters 7 of characters 8 of characters 9 of characters

The suit tiles are numbered 1 through 9, and in any given suit, there are four of each number.

There are two types of honour tiles. The winds (North, South, East, and West):

North South East West

and the dragons (Red, Green, and White):
